Status pages
------------

The following scripts generate HTML pages to visualize the status of the
package repositories:

* ``build_release_status_page.py`` shows the ROS packages of a specific ROS
  distribution and their package versions in the three repositories:

  * *building*,
  * *testing / shadow-fixed*
  * *main / ros / public*.

  Each page shows the packages and targets defined by a release build file.
